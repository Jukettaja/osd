Temperature Converter

General idea

JavaScript can be used to make converters, which only need a web browser to function. Many banks have loan calculators and in internet
you can find all kinds of converters, mainly integrated into google search already. This exercise is designed for a person travelling to USA,
who needs to convert weather forecast values from Fahrenheit to Celcius and from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  This is done in order to better
understand the temperature and enable means to do conversion even offline.

Specific task

Implement temperature converter, which converts temperature from fahrenheit to celsius and from celsius to fahrenheit. In the attached picture
you can also see Firefox Web Developer Tools, where at the console tab values of variables can be observed. You can get Web Developer to be
displayed by pressing F12 (works in many browsers). 

Step-by-step instructions

1. Get template lampotilamuunnin.html from address http://myy.haaga-helia.fi/~jusju/javascript/pohjat/t9/lampotilamuunnin.html
2. Program logic, which prints to the field of result temperature the right converted temperature.

Trace possible mistakes in your program by using command console.log to print out variable values and use Developer Toolbar to find
possible typing errors. Try for example in Firefox the functionality of debugger. 

Converting calculation is done so, that Fahrenheits can be converted to Celsius by deducting 32, then multiplying with 5 and
at the end dividing with 9.

Celsius is the same formula opposite way, which means that first you multiply celsius degrees with 9, then divide by five and
at last add 32. It is a good idea to use parenthesis to define which calculation is done first.

3. Save the file and test.
